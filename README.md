# PuppyCat Says

This is a Simon Says game with a theme inspired by the Netflix series *Bee and PuppyCat*. A sequence of PuppyCat noises play that the player then needs to match by either clicking on the appropriate Toe Bean or by using the corresponding keys (1-4). Each round another sound will be added to the series, until the player can no longer match it.

## How to Win

PuppyCat can kind of be a jerk, so there is no true "win" scenario. However, a player can do *well* by matching the order of noises PuppyCat makes for as many rounds as possible!
